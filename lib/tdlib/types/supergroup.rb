module TD::Types
  # Represents a supergroup or channel with zero or more members (subscribers in the case of channels).
  # From the point of view of the system, a channel is a special kind of a supergroup: only administrators can post and
  #   see the list of members, and posts from all administrators use the name and photo of the channel instead of individual
  #   names and profile photos.
  # Unlike supergroups, channels can have an unlimited number of subscribers.
