module TD::Types
  # Contains information about restrictions that must be applied to a chat or a message.
  #
  # @attr restriction_reason [TD::Types::String] A human-readable description of the reason why access to the content
  #   must be restricted.
  #   If empty, then the content can be accessed, but may be covered by hidden with 18+ spoiler anyway.
  # @attr has_sensitive_content [Boolean] True, if media content of the messages must be hidden with 18+ spoiler.
  #   Use value of the option "can_ignore_sensitive_content_restrictions" to check whether the current user can
  #   ignore the restriction.
  #   If age verification parameters were received in updateAgeVerificationParameters, then the user must complete
  #   age verification to ignore the restriction.
  #   Set the option "ignore_sensitive_content_restrictions" to true if the user passes age verification.
